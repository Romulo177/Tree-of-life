Because of that, most gene regulation occurs at the level of transcription in prokaryotes. However, in eukaryotes, the DNA is separated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope, so the mRNA has to find its way to the ribosomes from the nucleus. Gene activity can, therefore, be regulated at either transcription or translation, or even post-translation by modification of the translated protein. Another difference is that eukaryotic genes are not clustered into operons controlled from a single promoter. Most genes encode only a single protein, and each gene has its own promoter.",
